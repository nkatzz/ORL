    * solver, which generates instances by grounding only the variables that correspond to input terms.
    * The quotes are removed by post-processing each atom in an answer set, thus obtaining a query atom (i.e.
    * an atom of the form p(2,Y,Z) from the above). This is a query atom, which is subsequently used to
    * generate groundings of the atom that bind only Y,Z vars, keeping the input term intact.
