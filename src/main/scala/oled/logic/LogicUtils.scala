    * r1: initiatedAt(meet(X0,X1),X2) :- happensAt(active(X0),X2)
    * r2: initiatedAt(meet(X0,X1),X2) :- happensAt(active(X0),X2), close(X0,X1,24,X2)
    *
    * then only r2 is used for prediction.
    *
    * The rational is that since r2 has been generated, this means that it is of higher quality than r1
    * (since r2 was r1 at some point, but it got specialized).
    *
    * r1 has not been specialized, since no literal of sufficient gain exists in its bottom clause,
    * or it is too "young". In the first case it will be pruned away at some point, while in the second
    * case it will be specialized (into a version that differs from r2 itself).
